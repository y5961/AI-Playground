Name search
• User types a word or phrase.
• The system looks through each recipe’s name field and returns any recipe where the term appears (partial‑text matching).

Tag search
• User selects or enters a tag (e.g. cake, meat, quick).
• All recipes associated with that tag are returned.

Ingredient search
• User requests a particular ingredient (e.g. flour, egg).
• The system scans the ingredients list of every recipe.
• Any recipe containing that ingredient (matching the item field) is included in the results.

Queries can be combined (name + tag, ingredient + tag, etc.) to further narrow results.

This logic ensures fast, intuitive filtering: users get the matching set of recipes based on the keywords or tags they enter.
