In RecipeOrganizer the “tagging system” is nothing more than a flexible way to classify and query recipes across whatever sub‑projects you’re working on (meat, fish, cakes, etc.).

-Tags are arbitrary labels attached to a recipe – e.g. meat, fish, cake, salad, vegan, quick‑prep, etc.
-Each recipe will be in the place that best describes it, such as "chicken soup" in "soups."
-The various “projects” you mentioned (Meat, Fish, Cake, Cheesecake, Pastries, Salad, Soup, Dairy, Ice Cream, Add‑ons, Pies, Snacks) simply represent common tag sets or collections of recipes that share a theme.
-When you build the organizer UI or query engine, you filter by one or more tags to pull the appropriate recipes for that project.
-Tags are stored alongside the other recipe fields (name, ingredients, instructions, prep time) so they’re part of the recipe’s data model and can be updated easily.

In short: assign descriptive tags to each recipe and then use those tags to group recipes into “Meat”, “Fish”, “Cake”, etc., collections without duplicating content.
